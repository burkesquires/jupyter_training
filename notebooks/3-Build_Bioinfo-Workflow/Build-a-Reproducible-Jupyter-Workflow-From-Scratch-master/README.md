# Build a Reproducible Workflow From Scratch (in about an hour)

## NIH Hour of Code 2017

In this hands-on demonstration, we will utilize the Anaconda python distribution, Jupyter notebook, and python scientific stack to build a reproducible, bioinformatics workflow from scratch. From installation to automation, we will utilize the power of the Jupyter notebook and IPython kernel to seamlessly join a variety of existing components into a fully automated workflow that can be run with a single command. In this hands-on demonstration, we will utilize shell commands, popular bioinformatics applications, the Anaconda installer (conda), and the python programming language and scientific stack to assemble a workflow.

__Prerequisites__: none

If you'd like to follow along by webinar, you should have access to a computer with a Linux shell:
- Mac and Linux computers come with this installed
- Windows users may install [git-bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io), part of git for windows
- A recent installation of the [Anaconda python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for python 3.6
