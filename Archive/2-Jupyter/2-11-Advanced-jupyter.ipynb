    "Notebook automation - Papermill - 2. Jupyter is the new Bash\n",

A system called Papermill metaprograms a bespoke notebook with provided parameters pasted in, and then executes the notebook with zero user interaction required. For Netflix, the benefit of this approach is to simplify the development and debugging of these scripts. If a particular job breaks, it’s trivial to pop open the offending notebook in the normal Jupyter environment, and it has all the data built in that it needs to execute until hitting the error.\n",
